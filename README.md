# Introduction
The Newspapers in Samvera is an IMLS grant funded project to develop newspaper specific functionality for the [Samvera](http://samvera.org/) Hyrax framework.

## Documentation
We are currently working on adding and updating documentation on our [Project Wiki](https://github.com/marriott-library/newspaper_works/wiki)

# Overview
The Newspaper Works gem provides work type models and administrative
functionality for Hyrax-based Samvera applications in the space
of scanned newspaper media.  This gem can be included in a
Digital Asset Management application based on Hyrax 2.5

## Purpose, Use, and Aims
This gem, while not a stand-alone application, can be integrated into an
application based on Hyrax 2.5 easily to support a variety of cases for
management, ingest, and archiving of primarily scanned (historic) newspaper archives.

## Development Status
This gem is currently under development. The development team is actively working on this project and is updating the codebase nightly. We are targeting an initial 1.0 release for June 2019.

A public testing site is available for those interested in testing out the newspaper_works gem. [Newspaper Works Demo Site](https://newspaperworks.digitalnewspapers.org/)  **NOTE:** The demo site may not be running the latest release of Newspapers_Works.

## Requirements

  * [Ruby](https://rubyonrails.org/) >=2.4
  * [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) 5.1.6
  * [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)
  * [Hyrax](https://github.com/samvera/hyrax) 2.5
    - ..._and various [Samvera dependencies](https://github.com/samvera/hyrax#getting-started) that entails_.
  * A Hyrax-based Rails application.
    * newspaper_works is a gem/engine that can extend your application.

## Newspaper_works Dependencies

  * [FITS](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/fits/home)
  * [Tesseract-ocr](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/)
  * [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)
  * [ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/)
  * [poppler-utils](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/)
  * [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/)
  * [libcurl3](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=libcurl3)


## Newspapers PCDM metadata model

This model describes digitized newspaper content modeled using the PCDM ontology, and is intended to inform the development of RDF-based models for all types of newspaper content objects (titles, containers, issues, pages, articles, files), such as would be used in Samvera- or Islandora-based digital asset management applications.

This model was greatly informed by earlier efforts from National Library of Wales and University of Maryland, as well as discussions of the Samvera Newspapers Interest Group. This is essentially an attempt to reconcile these efforts and express them as a formal PCDM profile.

# Installation/Testing
Integrating newspaper_works in your application

Your Hyrax 2.5 based application can extend and utilize `newspaper_works`

## Extending, Using

* Add `gem 'newspaper_works', :git => 'https://github.com/marriott-library/newspaper_works.git'`
	to your Gemfile.
* Run `bundle install`
* Run `rails generate newspaper_works:generate`

### Ingest, Application Interface

_See [wiki](https://github.com/marriott-library/newspaper_works/wiki)_.

### Application/Site Specific Configuration


## Basic Model Use (console)

_More here soon!_

## Application/Site Specific Configuration
* In order to use some fields in forms, you will want to make sure you
have a [username for Geonames](http://www.geonames.org/login),
and configure that username in the
`config.geonames_username` value in `config/intitializers/hyrax.rb` of your app.

- This will help fields such as "Place of Publication" provide autocomplete using the Geonames service/vocabulary.

  * NewspaperWorks requires that your application's `config/initializers/hyrax.rb`
    be edited to make uploads optional for (all) work types, by setting
    `config.work_requires_files = false`.

  * NewspaperWorks expects that your application's `config/initializers/hyrax.rb`
    be edited to enable a IIIF viewer, by setting
    `config.iiif_image_server = true`.    

  * NewspaperWorks expects that your application's `config/initializers/hyrax.rb`
    be edited to set the FITS path, by setting
    `config.fits_path = /location/of/fits.sh`

  * NewspaperWorks expects that your application's `config/environments/production.rb`
    be edited to set file server to public, by setting
    `config.public_file_server.enabled = true`

  * NewspaperWorks overrides Hyrax's default `:after_create_fileset` event
    handler, in order to attach pre-existing derivatives in some ingest
    use cases.  The file attachment adapters for NewspaperWorks use this
    callback to allow programmatic assignment of pre-existing derivative
    files before the primary file's file set has been created for a new
    work.  The callback ensures that derivative files are attached,
    stored using Hyrax file/path naming conventions, once the file set
    has been created.  Because the Hyrax callback registry only allows single
    subscribers to any event, application developers who overwrite
    this handler, or integrate other gems that do likewise, must take care
    to create a custom composition that ensures all work and queued jobs
    desired run after this object lifecycle event.

## Development and Testing with Vagrant

### Host System Requirements (install these before proceeding)

* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) version 1.8.3+
* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) version 5.1.38+

### Test Environment Setup (provisioning of virtual machine)

1. Clone newspaper works samvera-vagrant `git clone https://github.com/marriott-library/samvera-vagrant.git`
2. Change the directory to the repository `cd samvera-vagrant`
3. Provision vagrant box by running `vagrant up`

You can shell into the machine with `vagrant ssh` or `ssh -p 2222 vagrant@localhost`

### Using/testing the Newspaper_works Application with Vagrant

* Ensure you're in the samvera-vagrant directory

* Start vagrant box provisioning (incase you have not provisioned the machine)
  - run `vagrant up`

* Shell into vagrant box **three times**
  - `vagrant ssh`

* First shell (start fcrepo_wrapper)
  - `cd /home/ubuntu/newspaper_works fcrepo_wrapper --config config/fcrepo_wrapper_test.yml`

* Second shell (start solr_wrapper)
  - `cd /home/ubuntu/newspaper_works solr_wrapper --config config/solr_wrapper_test.yml`

* Third shell testing and development

* Run spec tests
  - `cd /home/ubuntu/newspaper_works rake spec`
* Run rails console
  - `cd /home/ubuntu/newspaper_works rails s`

## Development and Testing Setup
* clone `newspaper_works`:
  - `git clone https://github.com/marriott-library/newspaper_works.git`
* Install Gem and dependencies:
  - `bundle install`
* Generate internal testing application
  - `rake engine_cart:generate`
* Each in a distinct terminal session, run Solr and Fedora Commons Wrappers:
  - `solr_wrapper --config config/solr_wrapper_test.yml`
  - `fcrepo_wrapper --config config/fcrepo_wrapper_test.yml`
* Now you can either:
  - Run tests via `rake spec` in the root of the `newspaper_works` gem.
  - Run an interactive Rails console in the generated testing app:
    - `rails`
* For development, you may want to include a clone of `newspaper_works`
  in your app's Gemfile, either via `github:` or by `path:` in a local
  Gemfile used only for local development of your app.
