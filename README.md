# Introduction
The Newspapers in Samvera is an IMLS grant funded project to develop newspaper specific functionality for the [Samvera](http://samvera.org/) Hyrax framework.

## Documentation
We are currently working on adding and updating documentation on our [Project Wiki](https://github.com/marriott-library/newspaper_works/wiki)

# Overview
The Newspaper Works gem provides work type models and administrative functionality for Hyrax-based Samvera applications in the space of scanned newspaper media.  This gem can be included in a Digital Asset Management application based on Hyrax 2.5.x

## Purpose, Use, and Aims
This gem, while not a stand-alone application, can be integrated into an application based on Hyrax 2.5.x easily to support a variety of cases for management, ingest, and archiving of primarily scanned (historic) newspaper archives.

## Development Status
This gem is currently under development. The development team is actively working on this project and is updating the codebase nightly. We are scheduled to release version 1.0 in September 2019.

A public testing site is available for those interested in testing out the newspaper_works gem. [Newspaper Works Demo Site](https://newspaperworks.digitalnewspapers.org/) **NOTE:** The demo site may not be running the latest release of Newspapers_Works.

## Requirements

  * [Ruby](https://rubyonrails.org/) >=2.4
  * [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) 5.1.7
  * [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)
  * [Hyrax](https://github.com/samvera/hyrax) 2.5.x
    - ..._and various [Samvera dependencies](https://github.com/samvera/hyrax#getting-started) that entails_.
  * A Hyrax-based Rails application.
    * Newspaper_works is a gem/engine that can extend your Hyrax application.

## Newspaper_works Dependencies

  * [FITS](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/fits/home)
  * [Tesseract-ocr](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/)
  * [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)
  * [ghostscript](https://www.ghostscript.com/)
  * [poppler-utils](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/)
  * [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/)
  * [libcurl3](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=libcurl3)

# Installing, Developing, and Testing
Newspaper_works easily integrates with your Hyrax 2.5.x applications.

## Extending and Using

* Add `gem 'newspaper_works', :git => 'https://github.com/marriott-library/newspaper_works.git'` to your Gemfile.
* Run `bundle install`
* Run `rails generate newspaper_works:generate`

### Ingest, Application Interface

_See [wiki](https://github.com/marriott-library/newspaper_works/wiki)_.

## Basic Model Use (console)

_More here soon!_

## Newspapers PCDM metadata model
[Detailed metadata model documents](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/samvera/PCDM+metadata+model+for+Newspapers)

## Application/Site Specific Configuration

#### Config changes made by the installer:
* In `app/controllers/catalog_controller.rb`, the `config.search_builder_class` is set to a new `CustomSearchBuiler` to support newspapers search features
* Additional facet fields for newspaper metadata are added to `app/controllers/catalog_controller.rb`
* Newspaper resource types added to `config/authorities/resource_types.yml`

(It may be helpful to run `git diff` after installation to see all the changes made by the installer.)

#### Configuration changes to _config/intitializers/hyrax.rb_ you should make after running the installer:

* set `config.geonames_username` Enables geonames [username for Geonames](http://www.geonames.org/login
* set `config.work_requires_files = false`
* set ` config.iiif_image_server = true`
* set `config.fits_path = /location/of/fits.sh`

#### Configuration changes to _config/environments/production.rb_ you should make after running the installer:

* set `config.public_file_server.enabled = true`

* NewspaperWorks overrides Hyrax's default `:after_create_fileset` More infomation can be found [here](https://github.com/marriott-library/newspaper_works/wiki/File-Attachment-Notes)

## Development and Testing with Vagrant

Additional information regarding development and testing environments setup and configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/marriott-library/newspaper_works/wiki/Installing,-Developing,-and-Testing)

### Host System Requirements (install these before proceeding)

* [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) version 1.8.3+
* [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) version 5.1.38+

### Test Environment Setup (provisioning of virtual machine)

1. Clone newspaper works samvera-newspapers-vagrant `git clone https://github.com/marriott-library/samvera-newspapers-vagrant.git`
2. Change the directory to the repository `cd samvera-newspapers-vagrant`
3. Provision vagrant box by running `vagrant up`
4. Shell into the machine with `vagrant ssh` or `ssh -p 2222 vagrant@localhost`

### Using/testing the Newspaper_works application with Vagrant
* Ensure you're in the samvera-newspapers-vagrant directory
* Start vagrant box provisioning (incase you have not provisioned the virtual machine)
  - `vagrant up`
* Shell into vagrant box **three times**
  - `vagrant ssh`
* First shell (start fcrepo_wrapper)
  - `cd /home/vagrant/newspaper_works fcrepo_wrapper --config config/fcrepo_wrapper_test.yml`
* Second shell (start solr_wrapper)
  - `cd /home/vagrant/newspaper_works solr_wrapper --config config/solr_wrapper_test.yml`
* Third shell testing and development
* Run spec tests
  - `cd /home/vagrant/newspaper_works rake spec`
* Run rails console
  - `cd /home/vagrant/newspaper_works rails s`

## Development and testing setup

* clone newspaper_works:
  - `git clone https://github.com/marriott-library/newspaper_works.git`
* Install Gem and dependencies:
  - `bundle install`
* Generate internal testing application
  - `rake engine_cart:generate`
* Each in a distinct terminal session, run Solr and Fedora Commons Wrappers:
  - `solr_wrapper --config config/solr_wrapper_test.yml`
  - `fcrepo_wrapper --config config/fcrepo_wrapper_test.yml`
* Now you can either:
  - Run tests via `rake spec` in the root of the `newspaper_works` gem.
  - Run an interactive Rails console in the generated testing app:
    - `rails`
* For development, you may want to include a clone of `newspaper_works` in your app's Gemfile, either via `github:` or by `path:` in a local Gemfile used only for local development of your app.
