===================================================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/marriott-library/newspaper_works.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/marriott-library/newspaper_works)

Overview
--------

The Newspaper Works gem provides work type models and administrative
functionality for Hyrax-based Samvera applications in the space
of scanned newspaper media.  This gem can be included in a
Digital Asset Management application based on Hyrax 2.x.

### Purpose, Use, and Aims

This gem, while not a stand-alone application, can be integrated into an
application based on Hyrax 2.x easily to support a variety of cases for
management and ingest of primarily scanned (historic) newspaper archives.

### Status

This gem/engine is in early development, but

Requirements
------------

  * Ruby
  * Rails 5.x
  * [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)
  * [Hyrax](https://github.com/samvera/hyrax) 2.x
    - ..._and all Samvera library and application dependencies that entails_.
  * A Hyrax-based Rails application.
    * `newspaper_works` is a gem/engine that can extend your application.
  * Application packages (via apt, yum, or homebrew): 
    - [poppler](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/) (e.g. `poppler-utils` package).
    - ghostscript, e.g. [GPL Ghostscript](https://ghostscript.com/GPL_Ghostscript_9.06.html)
    - [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org)
    - [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/) is highly recommended,
      and is required for development.

Integrating newspaper_works in Your Application
-----------------------------------------------

Your Hyrax 2.0 based application can extend and utilize `newspaper_works`

### Extending, Using

  * Add `gem 'newspaper_works'` to your Gemfile.
  * Run `bundle install`

### Basic Model Use (console)

_More here soon!_

### Ingest, Application Interface

_See [wiki](https://github.com/marriott-library/newspaper_works/wiki)_.

### Application/Site Specific Configuration

  * In order to use some fields in forms, you will want to make sure you
    have a [username for Geonames](http://www.geonames.org/login),
    and configure that username in the `config.geonames_username`
    value in `config/intitializers/hyrax.rb` of your app.

    - This will help fields such as "Place of Publication" provide
      autocomplete using the Geonames service/vocabulary.


Development and Testing Setup
-----------------------------

* Clone `newspaper_works`:
  - `git clone https://github.com/marriott-library/newspaper_works.git`
* Install Gem and dependencies:
  - `bundle install`
* Generate internal testing application
  - `rake engine_cart:generate`
* Each in a distinct terminal session, run Solr and Fedora Commons Wrappers:
  - `solr_wrapper --config config/solr_wrapper_test.yml`
  - `fcrepo_wrapper --config config/fcrepo_wrapper_test.yml`
* Now you can either:
  - Run tests via `rake spec` in the root of the `newspaper_works` gem.
  - Run an interactive Rails console in the generated testing app:
    - `cd .internal_test_app; rails c test`
* For development, you may want to include a clone of `newspaper_works`
  in your app's Gemfile, either via `github:` or by `path:` in a local
  Gemfile used only for local development of your app.
