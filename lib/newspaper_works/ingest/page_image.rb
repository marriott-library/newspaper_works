      #   - The page number is terminated by the period-plus-file-extension.
      #   - Both of the above can be determined by regular expression match.
      #   - Extraneous leading information in filename (e.g. datestamp) will
      #     be ignored.

      #     - 'Page1.tiff'
      #     - '2019091801-page_1.jp2'
